              <p>Seeing the end of my studies arrive, I see a year ahead of that will allow me to make the connection between my student life and the entry into the professional life. Having lived a few years in Auvergne, then some in Bretagne to finish in Savoie.I have always had a life full of adventure between my six brothers and sisters, my summits in mountains and my desires of escape to concretize by flights in gliders and paragliding. I like to discover the unknown, to leave a place in my life to the unexpected. It is in this project that I want to get involved to give the opportunity to put myself at the service. A little maturity for a 24 year old kid would not hurt.

               <p>
I am the next to last of a family of six children. Originally from Saint Gervais les Bains in Haute-Savoie, I had the chance to grow up in the mountains. And it is the mountain that I think gave me the taste for adventure and transcending me. After four years of study in engineering school in Lille, where was I able to form technically but also to grow in maturity, I felt the need to embark on another adventure, more oriented towards others and the world Which surrounds me. Indeed, the world we live in becomes more and more complex and I burn with desire to go and see with my own eyes how "others" live! So this project between Earth and Heaven really holds my heart and I will do everything to carry it out

              <p>
To set up a project of this magnitude, the qualities of at least two cousins ​​seemed indispensable to us. So it was during the discussions that we took the decision to block a year on the same dates and to think about a common project of mission. This idea came to us as a result of adventures lived together. It is through our common passion for the mountain that we have learned to make only one team, one ropeway, and it is therefore by the mountain in particular that we have focused our project. This will allow our fine team to discover on the ground what is happening in the countries of the Middle East, an action that is difficult to decipher in newspapers.
